# budget_blackout

A simple Android app that facilitates the choice of which alcohol to buy if you only care about price!

## Features

* Compare multiple bottles of alcohol to find the cheapest option for getting drunk.  
* Edit or delete bottles you've already added.  
* The list is sorted by default to show the best deals first.  
* Your entries are saved, so you don't have to re-enter them each time you open the app.  

## Notes

* I am fully aware of the fact that this app could've been vibe coded in 20 minutes and it would still be better. However, this project started as a way for me to learn Flutter. If you want to code this idea with AI and monetize it, feel free to do so. 
* More features may be added in the future, but for now, I'm happy that it works.  

## Installation

1. Download the latest release APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/bzbrn/budget_blackout/releases) section.  
2. On your Android device, allow installation from unknown sources (Settings → Security → Install unknown apps).  
3. Open the downloaded APK to install the app.  
4. Launch the app and start adding bottles!
